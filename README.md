//Project Overview

In this Python project for Diwali sales data analysis, we aim to identify the target demographic for purchasing products from the Food, Clothing, and Electronics categories. Our analysis focuses on married women aged 26-35 years from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, working in the IT, Healthcare, and Aviation industries. We utilize popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.
Data Collection and Preparation

The first step involves collecting and preparing the Diwali sales data. This dataset should include information on customer demographics, products purchased, and sales figures. We clean and preprocess the data using Pandas to ensure it is ready for analysis.
Data Analysis

Using Pandas, we filter the data to focus on the target demographic of interest - married women aged 26-35 years from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, working in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation. We then analyze their purchasing behavior across the Food, Clothing, and Electronics categories.
Visualization

Matplotlib and Seaborn are utilized to create insightful visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, and scatter plots to represent the purchasing patterns of the target demographic. These visualizations help in understanding trends and patterns in the data.
Conclusion

Based on our analysis, we conclude that married women aged 26-35 years from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, working in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation, are more likely to purchase products from the Food, Clothing, and Electronics categories. This information can be valuable for marketing strategies and product placement during the Diwali sales season.
